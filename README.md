This open source package is an extension to OpenSAML 2.X and 3.X that offers utility classes and interfaces such as:

* Easier initialization of the OpenSAML libraries.
* Utility methods for creating OpenSAML objects that does not require using the builder classes directly.
* Utility methods for marshalling and unmarshalling.
* Simplified support for signing XML objects.
* An abstraction for metadata handling making it easier to download and use SAML metadata.
* Spring Framework factory beans for easier integration in a Spring environment.
* A builder pattern for some commonly used objects, such as creating SAML attribute objects, entity descriptors (metadata) or authentication requests.
